# XML/XPath support for Artillery

This is an optional dependency for Artillery to enable parsing and capturing XML in HTTP responses.

This code used be part of `artillery-core` but it has been extracted into a separate package, because of frequent build/installation problems with `libxmljs`.

You **SHOULD NOT** need to install this package manually - it's part of Artillery's (optional) dependencies.
